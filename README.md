# CALERIEtiming
Once you acquire the data (see notebook for instructions on how to do so), this repo allows you to regenerate the figures and analyses in the paper (in submission) "Associations between the timing of eating and health outcomes in calorically restricted healthy adults: a post-hoc analysis from the CALERIE study" by Jason G. Fleischer, Sai Das, and Satchidananda Panda.

Even without the data, this also allows you to see several analysese that were not highlighted in the paper, and maybe helps convince you that the methods were good. Think of it as a super supplemental info.
